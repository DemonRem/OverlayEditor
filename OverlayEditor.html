<h2><img style="border: 0px solid; vertical-align: middle;" src="Resources/OverlayEditor.png"> DSF overlay scenery editor</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This application edits X-Plane<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small> DSF overlay scenery packages for X-Plane 8.30 or later. It runs on Windows 2000 or later, MacOS 10.5 or later and Linux.</p>
<p>This document is a reference - it is assumed that you're familiar with the basics of X-Plane's scenery system. Please read the section <a href="#other">below</a> if you intend to use OverlayEditor in conjunction with other scenery tools.<p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>
<p>The first time that you run the application you are asked to identify X-Plane's top-level folder (<i>i.e.</i> the folder which contains the X-Plane, Plane-Maker etc applications).<p>

<h3>The application window</h3>
<p>The application window consists of five parts. Click on this screenshot for a description:</p>

<h4><a name="objectlist">List of objects</a></h4>
<p>All the objects, facades etc in the scenery package folder are listed under the heading &ldquo;<samp>Objects in this package</samp>&rdquo; (including those that are present in the scenery package folder but are not used in the scenery). When you create a new scenery package &ldquo;<samp>Objects in this package</samp>&rdquo; is initially empty, but objects that have been made available by scenery libraries, including X-Plane's built-in libraries, are listed under further headings in the drop-down list. <small>(Note that later versions of X-Plane come with more extensive libraries than earlier versions, so you you should always design using the earliest version of X-Plane that you want your scenery package to work with)</small>.</p>
<p>You can use any of the objects in these lists in your scenery package - think of these lists as an artist's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_(painting)">palette</a>. You can also use the <samp>Search</samp> box to search through the available objects by name. Select one of the objects in these lists and press <img class="inlbutton" alt="Add" src="Resources/add.png"></td> to place it in your scenery package.</p>
<p>The type of object is indicated by a symbol:</p>
<dl>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="obj" src="Resources/obj.png"> - 3D object (<code>.obj</code>)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="fac" src="Resources/fac.png"> - Facade polygon (<code>.fac</code>)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="for" src="Resources/for.png"> - Forest polygon (<code>.for</code>)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="pol" src="Resources/pol.png"> - Draped polygon (<code>.pol</code>) with a <a target="_blank" href="http://xplanescenery.blogspot.com/2007/02/polygons-part-3-airport-grass-terrain.html">repeating texture</a> (requires X-Plane 8.50 or later)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="ortho" src="Resources/ortho.png"> - Draped polygon (<code>.pol</code>) for use as an <a target="_blank" href="http://xplanescenery.blogspot.com/2007/02/polygons-part-5-orthophotos.html">orthophoto</a> (requires X-Plane 8.60 or later)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="lin" src="Resources/lin.png"> - Line polygon (<code>.lin</code>)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="str" src="Resources/str.png"> - String polygon (<code>.str</code>)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="unknown" src="Resources/unknown.png"> - Other polygon</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="net" src="Resources/net.png"> - Road, Railway or Powerline network (requires X-Plane 10 or later)</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="exc" src="Resources/exc.png"> - Exclusion region</dd>
  <dd><img class="inlsymbol" alt="bad" src="Resources/bad.png"> - Missing or unreadable object or polygon</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once you place a 3D object (denoted by the symbol <img class="inlsymbol" alt="obj" src="Resources/obj.png">) in your scenery package you can move, rotate or delete it <small>(see <a href="#manipkeys">above<a> for the keys to use)</small> and that's about it. The other types of objects are all &ldquo;polygons&rdquo; of various kinds. You can click on the &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> corners) of a polygon and drag to change the polygon's shape, and you can press <img class="inlbutton" alt="AddNode" src="Resources/addnode.png"> to add new nodes. Most polygon types also have properties that can be changed with the <kbd>R</kbd> and <kbd>F</kbd></td> <a href="#manipkeys">keys<a>.</p>
<p>Some library objects are shown in these lists with a symbol <img class="inlsymbol" alt="objs" src="Resources/objs.png"> or <img class="inlsymbol" alt="facs" src="Resources/facs.png"> instead of the normal symbol <img class="inlsymbol" alt="obj" src="Resources/obj.png"> or <img class="inlsymbol" alt="fac" src="Resources/fac.png">. This means that the library object exists in multiple versions; X-Plane will choose which version of the object to display at random, but this application always displays the same version.</p>
<p>Use <a href="#import"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Import" src="Resources/import.png"></a> to copy objects from another scenery <u>package</u> or from a downloaded collection of scenery objects. The imported objects will appear under the &ldquo;<samp>Objects in this package</samp>&rdquo; heading. (Don't use this to copy objects from a scenery <u>library</u>; just select the object from the appropriate list).</p>
<p>Use <a href="#reload"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Reload" src="Resources/reload.png"></a> if you have otherwise added or modified objects in the scenery package folder, or if you have installed a new scenery library.</p>

<h4><a name="preview">Preview picture</a></h4>
<p>A preview of the currently selected object is shown (when available) underneath the list of objects.</p>
<p>You can drag the separators between the preview window and the other windows to make the preview picture larger or smaller.</p>

<h4><a name="statusbar">Status bar</a></h4>
<p>This area shows the cursor location, heading and elevation. If you have selected an object or polygon this area also shows details about it (or an average location if you have selected more than one object).</p>

<h3>Road, Railway &amp; Powerline Networks</h3>
<p>Roads, railways and powerlines (collectively &ldquo;networks&rdquo;) work similarly to other kinds of polygons, but there are some additional points to bear in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In order for traffic to flow across successive segments of road or rail, the first or last node of one segment must be at <u>exactly</u> the same location as the first or last node of the next segment. (However the two segments don't have to be of the same type).</li>
  <li>When multiple roads and/or railways meet at a junction, in order for X-Plane to draw the junction correctly the first or last nodes of all the segments that meet at the junction must be in <u>exactly</u> the same location.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help with this, when you drag the first or last node of a network segment it will &ldquo;snap&rdquo; to any nearby nodes in other segments. And if the &ldquo;snapped-to&rdquo; node is in the middle of its segment, that segment will be split in two.</p>
<p>To construct a bridge over a road or railway:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a four-way junction / crossroads - <i>i.e.</i> four segments with their first or last nodes at <u>exactly</u> the same location.</li>
  <li>Select the end node of one of the segments that you want to turn into a bridge and use the <kbd>R</kbd> and <kbd>F</kbd> keys to set the node's <samp>level</samp> to 1 or more. The current level is shown in the status bar, and higher levels result in a higher bridge.</li>
  <li>Repeat for the end node of the other &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; segment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: OverlayEditor doesn't display the bridge segments as being raised, so you may have to experiment a little.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="#preferences"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Preferences" src="Resources/prefs.png"></a> to make OverlayEditor display networks from the default scenery (in outline form). But X-Plane will not join network segments in your scenery package to segments from the default scenery, and traffic will not flow between them. You can use an Exclusion region to remove network segments from the default scenery, and then replace them with your own.</p>

<h3>Differences between this application and X-Plane</h3>
<p>This application displays terrain and objects in orthogonal projection (no perspective) and in a simplified form. <i>i.e.</i>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No lights, lines, materials, shading or animation. 3D objects that only contain lights or lines are displayed as small &ldquo;placeholders&rdquo; so that they can be edited.</li>
  <li>This application can only display 3D objects, facades, draped polygons, lines, strings and networks. Other types of polygon (beaches, forests, <i>etc</i>) are displayed as an outline. Beach polygons cannot be edited.</li>
  <li>When you add a new draped polygon this application behaves differently
depending on the contents of the <code>.pol</code> file:
    <ul>
      <li>A draped polygon (<code>.pol</code>) file that contains a
<code>TEXTURE</code> statement is assumed to be intended for use as a
<a href="http://xplanescenery.blogspot.com/2007/02/polygons-part-3-airport-grass-terrain.html">repeating texture</a> (requires X-Plane 8.50 or later).</li>
      <li>A draped polygon (<code>.pol</code>) file that contains a
<code>TEXTURE_NOWRAP</code> statement is assumed to be intended for use as a quadrilateral <a href="http://xplanescenery.blogspot.com/2007/02/polygons-part-5-orthophotos.html">orthophoto</a> (requires X-Plane 8.60 or later).
OverlayEditor does not allow you to add nodes or holes to orthophotos.</li>
    </ul>
X-Plane lets you use the same draped polygon (<code>.pol</code>) file
for either purpose but you will see visual artefacts if you use a
<code>TEXTURE</code> statement in an orthophoto or use a
<code>TEXTURE_NOWRAP</code> statement in a repeating texture.</li>
  <li>Network bridges can be constructed and edited, but all networks are displayed at ground level.</li>
  <li>X-Plane allows some types of polygons and networks to use bezier curves,
however this application does not understand or display bezier polygon or network curves.
Any bezier control points will be deleted if you edit the polygon or network.</li>
  <li>Terrain textures are simplified - no beaches or overlay textures.</li>
  <li>No flattening of terrain around airports. Terrain is displayed as if the X-Plane &ldquo;allow sloped runways&rdquo; rendering setting is turned on.</li>
</ul>
<a name="priority">
<p>X-Plane prioritises scenery packages. Prior to X-Plane 10.10 a package's priority is determined by its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCIIbetical">ASCIIbetical</a> order in the <code>Custom&nbsp;Scenery</code> folder. Since X-Plane 10.10 a package's priority is determined by its order in the <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.x-plane.com/2012/09/scenery-packs-the-new-rules/"><code>Custom&nbsp;Scenery/scenery_packs.ini</code></a> file. You can see the order in which X-Plane prioritises your packages by looking at the file <code>Log.txt</code> in X-Plane's top-level folder.<br>
X-Plane will not load or display a scenery package if it has a lower priority than a &ldquo;full&rdquo; DSF scenery package (<i>i.e.</i> one containg a terrain mesh) for the same area, but this application will not warn you about this problem.</p>
<p>When you open or reload a scenery package this application warns about any
objects that are missing or that it can't read, but lets you edit and save
the scenery package anyway. X-Plane will display an error unless you
either provide implementations of missing and unreadable objects, or remove
all uses of these objects from the scenery.<p>
<p>X-Plane supports having multiple versions of a single library object,
and chooses which object to display at random.
However, this application always displays the first version of an object
that it comes across.
Many objects in the default libraries exist in multiple versions - <i>e.g.</i> the library object <code>/lib/global8/us/in_sq_90_30r.obj</code> exists in at least eight different versions; if you use that object in your scenery package then this application will always display the same version, but X-Plane will display one of the eight versions chosen at random.<p>

<h3><a name="other">Using OverlayEditor in conjunction with other scenery tools</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of other applications that can create X-Plane scenery packages. Those applications that place scenery objects work by writing &ldquo;overlay&rdquo; <code>.dsf</code> files into a scenery package folder. OverlayEditor can read and edit &ldquo;overlay&rdquo; <code>.dsf</code> files produced by other applications; but of course if you re-run the other application you may overwrite any edits that you have made using OverlayEditor.</p>
<p>In particular, the WED application can be used to both to create X-Plane airport layouts and to place scenery objects. You can safely use WED to create and edit airport layout(s) and OverlayEditor to place scenery objects within the same scenery package <b>as long as you only use the <samp>File &rarr; Export&nbsp;apt.dat</samp> menu option in WED</b> and avoid the <samp>File &rarr; Export&nbsp;Scenery&nbsp;Pack</samp> menu option.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>OverlayEditor is too slow</h4>
<p>OverlayEditor needs to load lots of textures and uses much more memory
if the preferences are set to display terrain. Closing other applications,
particularly applications like X-Plane that also make heavy use of textures,
will make OverlayEditor load faster. Or you can tell OverlayEditor not to
display terrain; press
<a href="#preferences"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Prefs" src="Resources/prefs.png"></a> and select &ldquo;No terrain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Editing is slower when the preferences are set to display terrain elevation.
This is particularly noticable when editing polygons because OverlayEditor
has to fit the polygons to the terrain mesh. OverlayEditor runs much
faster if you tell it not to display elevation; press
<a href="#preferences"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Prefs" src="Resources/prefs.png"></a> and select &ldquo;No terrain&rdquo; or &ldquo;Show terrain&rdquo;.
<!-- But note that you need to display elevation in order to edit network segments. --></p>

<h4>OverlayEditor complains that it &ldquo;Can't read one or more objects&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Your scenery package uses objects that are either missing or unreadable. Missing or unreadable 3D objects are displayed as small &ldquo;placeholders&rdquo;. Missing or unreadable polygons are displayed as &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; shapes.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>To delete all uses of the missing or unreadable 3D object or polygon in the current 1&deg;&times;1&deg; region:</dt>
  <dd>Select the 3D object or polygon in the <a href="#objectlist">list of objects</a><br>
    Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>N</kbd><br>
    Press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <img class="inlbutton" alt="Delete" src="Resources/delete.png"></dd>
</dl>

<h4>OverlayEditor complains that it &ldquo;Can't read one or more textures&rdquo;</h4>
<p>This happens when OverlayEditor fails to find or read the texture file
listed in your object(s).<br>
OverlayEditor expects the texture filename to have the correct case -
edit your object to correct the texture filename.<br>
OverlayEditor cannot read interlaced PNG files - save your
PNG file in 24bit or 32bit non-interlaced format.<br>
Then press <a href="#reload"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Reload" src="Resources/reload.png"></a> to tell OverlayEditor to re-read your objects and textures.<br>
Note that OverlayEditor only reports problems with textures when you load or
reload a scenery package, and when you first add an object to the scenery.</p>

<h4>My 3D object just appears as a small grey blob in OverlayEditor</h4>
<p>OverlayEditor doesn't draw lights or lines - 3D objects that only contain lights or lines are displayed as small &ldquo;placeholders&rdquo;. This is a limitation of the application.</p>
    
<h4>My forest/draped polygon just appears as a red outline in OverlayEditor</h4>
<p>In X-Plane polygons must be &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon">simple</a>&rdquo;, <i>i.e.</i> a polygon's sides must not intersect each other. X-Plane won't display non-simple polygons. OverlayEditor displays non-simple polygons as a bright red outline.</p>

<h4>OverlayEditor won't let me place my object/node exactly where I want it</h4>
<p>This is a limitation of the DSF file format as currently used by X-Plane.<br>
Laminar's scenery tools encode DSF files with a precision of approximately 0.0000005&deg;, which at the equator is about 5 cm or 2 inches. To avoid objects and nodes shifting when you save and re-open your scenery package, or when you view your scenery package in X-Plane, OverlayEditor doesn't let you place objects or polygon nodes with finer precision than that supported by the DSF files.</p>
    
<h4>I want to remove some scenery objects from the default scenery</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>You can use an exclusion region:</dt>
  <dd>Navigate to the area from which you want to remove the scenery objects.</dd>
  <dd>Select &ldquo;Exclusions&rdquo; from the drop-down <a href="#objectlist">Objects</a> menu.</dd>
  <dd>Choose the type of object that you want to exclude.</dd>
  <dd>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <img class="inlbutton" alt="Add" src="Resources/add.png">.</dd>
  <dd>Drag the corners of the new region as desired.</dd>
</dl>
<p>OverlayEditor doesn't display the &ldquo;autogen&rdquo; scenery objects, so you may have to experiment a bit.</p>
<p>Exclusion regions are always rectangular (you can't add or delete nodes) and can't be rotated. You can make up more complex shapes by adding multiple exclusion regions.</p>

<h4>I want to remove some scenery objects from another scenery package</h4>
<p>Follow the above procedure. In addition, your scenery package must have a
<a href="#priority">higher priority</a> than the other package.
So you may need to rename one of the two packages to change their relative
priority.</p>
<p>Exclusion regions exclude objects from <u>other</u>, lower priority,
scenery packages, not from the scenery package that contains them.</p>

<h4>I want to change the elevation of a scenery object</h4>
<p>OverlayEditor just places scenery objects (other than network segments)
directly on top of the terrain mesh.
To change the apparent elevation of a 3D object you need to edit the object
using a 3D modelling application.</p>

<h4>X-Plane does not display any of my scenery objects</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>Check that OverlayEditor saved your package correctly:</dt>
  <dd>Run OverlayEditor again, open your scenery package and check that
it looks OK.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Check that OverlayEditor saved your package in the correct copy of X-Plane:</dt>
  <dd>Press <a href="#preferences"><img class="inlbutton" alt="Prefs" src="Resources/prefs.png"></a> and check that the &ldquo;X-Plane location&rdquo; points to the copy of X-Plane that you're running.<br>
If it doesn't, change the &ldquo;X-Plane location&rdquo; setting. Then, in Explorer or the Finder, move your scenery package folder to the copy of X-Plane that you're running.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Check your X-Plane settings:</dt>
  <dd>Run X-Plane and choose <samp>Settings &rarr; Rendering&nbsp;Options</samp>.<br>
Check that &ldquo;number of objects&rdquo; is not set to &ldquo;None&rdquo;.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt>Check that X-Plane found your scenery package:</dt>
  <dd>Quit X-Plane. Open the file <code>Log.txt</code> in the top-level
X-Plane folder.
Your scenery package should be listed at least twice in this file;
firstly in the list of scenery packages, eg:
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code><i>n</i> Custom Scenery\<i>My package</i>\</code></div>
and secondly when X-Plane loads the DSF(s) from your scenery package, eg:
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>DSF load time: <i>nnn</i> for file Custom Scenery\<i>My package</i>\Earth nav data:+50-010\+51-001.dsf</code></div>
If X-Plane is not loading DSFs from your package then this is probably
because another package has a <a href="#priority">higher priority</a>
than your package.
Look in <code>Log.txt</code> to see which DSF files X-Plane is loading from
the<code> Custom&nbsp;Scenery </code>folder - this will tell you the name
of the package that is hiding your package.<br>
Rename one or both of the packages to change their relative priority.</dd>
</dl>
