# OverlayEditor

This application edits [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com/) DSF "overlay" scenery packages for X-Plane 8.30 or later.
It runs on Windows 2000 or later, MacOS 10.5 or later and Linux.

The application allows you to place 3D objects, building facades, draped textures, roads and other kinds of scenery objects on top of X-Plane's terrain. The application does not edit X-Plane airport layouts (_i.e._ runways, taxiways and navaids) and does not edit X-Plane's terrain mesh, but it does read and display both of these in simplified form so you can see where you're placing your objects.
